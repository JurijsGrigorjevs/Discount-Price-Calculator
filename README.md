# Discount Price Calculator

Shopping during the sales can sometimes be very confusing. With discounted prices at 10%, 20%, 50% or even 70%!

For this challenge we are going to write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a price in pounds ( or in your own currency ) (e.g. £90) and a discount rate to apply (e.g. 20%)

Our program will then calculate and display the discounted price.
